**No UI. No database schema. No API. No application code.**  
This document defines **how business processes flow** across AgainERP HR & Payroll — state machines, approval chains, notifications, activity, escalation, and audit. Foundation for UI design, database design, API design, automation engine, notification engine, and AI HR Assistant.

---

## Executive Summary

HR & Payroll workflows are **declarative processes** registered with the **Core Workflow Engine** and gated by the **Core Approval Engine**. HR and Payroll modules own **business rules and hooks**; Core owns **state, approval routing, notifications, and activity timeline**.

| Engine | HR & Payroll usage |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Workflow Engine** | All document lifecycles (`hr.leave`, `payroll.run`, `hr.recruitment`, …) |
| **Approval Engine** | Human gates on leave, corrections, payroll, loans, expenses |
| **Notification Engine** | Email, SMS, in-app on every transition |
| **Activity Engine** | Immutable timeline on every action |
| **Event Bus** | Cross-module integration (Accounting, Inventory) |

**Workflow IDs namespace:** `hr.*` · `payroll.*` · `ess.*`

---

## Workflow Philosophy

### Core belief

> **Process is configuration, not code.** Admins define chains; the platform enforces them; every step is audited.

HR & Payroll spans high-frequency operations (daily attendance) and high-risk operations (payroll lock, salary revision, termination). The workflow architecture separates:

| Layer | Responsibility |
|-------|----------------|
| **Platform** | State machine, approval inbox, SLA, escalation, notifications, activity |
| **HR / Payroll module** | Domain guards, calculations, checklist items, event payloads |
| **Integration** | Subscribers react to events — never bypass workflow |

### Design stance (adapted from enterprise HCM)

| Source pattern | AgainERP adaptation |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Odoo HR approvals | Manager → HR chains on leave and expense |
| Workday business processes | Lifecycle stages with checklist tasks |
| SAP workflow | Payroll run segregation of duties |
| ERPNext HRMS | Practical payroll: draft → submit → approve → pay |

AgainERP **does not** build a second workflow engine inside HR — all flows register with Core.

### Module off behavior

When HR & Payroll is disabled: workflow instances for `hr.*` and `payroll.*` do not start; pending items remain frozen; no new instances created; Core inbox hides HR items.

---

## Workflow Design Principles

| # | Principle | Rule |
|---|-----------|------|
| 1 | **One engine** | No custom `status` columns as source of truth — `workflow_instances.current_state_id` |
| 2 | **Approval-native** | Transitions that need human gate call Approval Engine |
| 3 | **Event on transition** | Every transition emits `core.workflow.transitioned` + module event |
| 4 | **Activity on action** | Every transition writes Activity log with actor and payload |
| 5 | **Idempotent hooks** | Module actions safe to retry (payroll calculate, attendance finalize) |
| 6 | **SoD enforced** | Submitter ≠ approver; calculator ≠ payroll approver |
| 7 | **Company scoped** | Workflow definitions and instances carry `company_id` |
| 8 | **Configurable chains** | Approval policies per company/branch/amount/days |
| 9 | **Fail closed** | Guard failure blocks transition; no silent skip |
| 10 | **AI suggests, human approves** | AI recommendations never auto-approve payroll or termination |
| 11 | **Immutable posted state** | Terminal payroll states require reversal workflow |
| 12 | **Checklist optional** | Onboarding/exit use checklist tasks parallel to workflow |

### Standard workflow instance fields (conceptual)

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `workflow_id` | e.g. `hr.leave` |
| `entity_type` | e.g. `hr_leave_request` |
| `entity_id` | Record UUID |
| `company_id` | Scope |
| `branch_id` | Optional branch policy |
| `current_state_id` | Active state |
| `initiated_by` | User |
| `approval_request_id` | Link to Core approval when pending |

---

## Approval Architecture

HR & Payroll consumes the **Core Approval Engine** per [APPROVAL_ENGINE_ARCHITECTURE.md](../../02-core-platform/engines/APPROVAL_ENGINE_ARCHITECTURE.md).

### Integration pattern

```text
User action (submit)
        ↓
Workflow transition → pending_approval
        ↓
Approval Engine: resolve policy → create approval_request → assign steps
        ↓
Approver acts (approve / reject / delegate)
        ↓
All steps complete → Workflow transition → approved
        ↓
Module hook (e.g. deduct leave balance, lock payroll)
        ↓
Event + Notification + Activity
```

### HR approval policies (registered)

| Policy ID | Document | Condition | Default chain |
|-----------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| `hr.leave.standard` | Leave request | days ≤ 3 | `line_manager` |
| `hr.leave.extended` | Leave request | days > 3 | `line_manager_hr` |
| `hr.leave.unpaid` | Leave request | unpaid type | `line_manager_hr` |
| `hr.attendance.correction` | Attendance correction | any | `line_manager_hr` |
| `hr.overtime.standard` | OT request | hours ≤ 4 | `line_manager` |
| `hr.overtime.extended` | OT request | hours > 4 | `line_manager_hr` |
| `hr.loan.standard` | Employee loan | principal ≤ threshold | `manager_hr` |
| `hr.loan.high` | Employee loan | principal > threshold | `manager_hr_finance` |
| `hr.advance.standard` | Salary advance | amount ≤ threshold | `manager_hr` |
| `hr.advance.high` | Salary advance | amount > threshold | `manager_hr_finance` |
| `hr.expense.standard` | Expense claim | amount ≤ threshold | `line_manager` |
| `hr.expense.high` | Expense claim | amount > threshold | `line_manager_finance` |
| `hr.travel.standard` | Travel request | any | `line_manager_hr` |
| `hr.recruitment.requisition` | Job requisition | any | `hiring_manager_hr` |
| `hr.recruitment.offer` | Offer letter | comp above band | `hr_manager_director` |
| `hr.salary.revision` | Salary revision | % change > threshold | `hr_manager_finance` |
| `payroll.run.standard` | Payroll run | any | `payroll_officer_hr_manager` |
| `payroll.run.high` | Payroll run | total > threshold | `payroll_officer_hr_finance` |
| `hr.promotion.recommendation` | Promotion | any | `manager_hr` |
| `hr.training.request` | Training enrollment | cost > threshold | `manager_hr` |
| `hr.asset.request` | Asset request | any | `manager_it_hr` |
| `ess.profile.update` | Profile change | sensitive fields | `hr_review` |

### Approval chain types used

| Type | HR example |
|------|------------|
| **Single** | Half-day leave → manager only |
| **Multi-level sequential** | Loan → manager → HR → finance |
| **Parallel** | Offer approval: HR + Finance simultaneously |
| **Conditional** | Leave days > 3 adds HR step |
| **Role-based** | `hr.leave.approve`, `payroll.run.approve` |
| **Amount-based** | Loan principal tiers |
| **Company-based** | Different chains per `company_id` in group |

### Separation of duties (HR-specific)

| Rule | Enforcement |
|------|-------------|
| Employee cannot approve own leave | SoD on approval step |
| Payroll calculator cannot approve same run | `payroll.runs.create` ≠ `payroll.runs.approve` |
| Payroll approver cannot post to GL alone | Requires `payroll.runs.post` + Accounting period open |
| HR who created offer cannot approve offer | Recruitment SoD |
| Manager cannot approve own OT | Route to skip-level manager |

---

## Escalation Architecture

Escalation is **Core Approval Engine** capability — HR registers SLA per policy.

### Default SLA matrix

| Workflow | Step | SLA | Escalate to |
|----------|------|-----|-------------|
| Leave request | Manager | 24h | Skip-level manager |
| Leave request | HR | 48h | HR Manager |
| Attendance correction | Manager | 48h | Department head |
| Overtime | Manager | 24h | Department head |
| Payroll run | HR Manager | 4h (pay day) | Company Admin |
| Loan | Finance | 72h | Finance Controller |
| Expense | Manager | 48h | Department head |

### Escalation flow

```text
Step assigned → SLA timer starts
        ↓
Reminder at 50% SLA (in-app + email)
        ↓
SLA breached → auto-escalate to fallback approver
        ↓
Activity: escalation event logged
        ↓
Notification: escalation alert to original + new approver
```

### Delegation

Out-of-office delegation via Core — approver assigns delegate; inbox routes to `delegate_user_id`; audit shows both names.

---

## Notification Architecture

HR & Payroll **emits notification intents** — Core Notification Engine delivers per [NOTIFICATION_ENGINE_ARCHITECTURE.md](../../02-core-platform/engines/NOTIFICATION_ENGINE_ARCHITECTURE.md).

### Trigger model

```text
Workflow transition OR domain event
        ↓
HR notification rule (template + recipients)
        ↓
Core: render template → check preferences → queue → channel adapter
        ↓
Delivery log + Activity (optional)
```

### HR notification categories

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| `hr.approval.pending` | Leave, OT, loan awaiting approver |
| `hr.approval.decided` | Approved/rejected to requester |
| `hr.payroll.payslip` | Payslip published |
| `hr.attendance.alert` | Missing punch, late pattern |
| `hr.document.expiry` | Passport/visa expiring |
| `hr.onboarding.task` | Checklist item assigned |
| `hr.exit.clearance` | Pending clearance step |
| `hr.announcement` | Company broadcast |
| `hr.escalation` | SLA breach |

### Channels

| Channel | Use case | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| **In-app** | All approvals, alerts | Active |
| **Email** | Payslip, offer letter, leave decision | Active |
| **SMS** | Urgent approval, OTP (ESS) | Active |
| **WhatsApp** | Payslip link, approval reminder | Future |
| **Push** | Mobile ESS | Future |

### Recipient resolution

| Role | Resolution |
|------|------------|
| Requester | `employee.user_id` or `contact.email` |
| Line manager | `hr_employees.manager_id` → user |
| HR pool | Role `HR Executive` scoped to company |
| Payroll officer | Role `Payroll Officer` |
| Finance | Policy chain step assignee |

---

## Activity Log Architecture

Every workflow action generates Activity entries per [ACTIVITY_CHATTER_ARCHITECTURE.md](../../02-core-platform/subsystems/ACTIVITY_CHATTER_ARCHITECTURE.md).

### Mandatory logging points

| Point | Activity type |
|-------|---------------|
| Workflow instance created | `create` |
| State transition | `status_change` |
| Field change on submit | `update` + field diff |
| Approval submitted | `approval` |
| Approval decided | `approved` / `rejected` |
| Escalation | `system` |
| Payroll calculation | `workflow` |
| Soft delete | `delete` |
| Restore | `restore` |

### HR domain activity types (extended)

`transferred` · `promoted` · `salary_changed` · `attendance_changed` · `leave_changed` · `payroll_locked` · `payroll_posted` · `asset_assigned` · `asset_returned` · `hired` · `terminated`

### Entity registration

All workflow-backed entities register `entity_type` with Activity Engine: `hr_employee`, `hr_leave_request`, `hr_attendance`, `payroll_run`, `payroll_payslip`, `hr_candidate`, `hr_loan`, etc.

---

## Multi Company Workflow Rules

Per [database/multi-company.md](../../05-development/database/multi-company.md).

| Rule | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Instance scope** | Every workflow instance has `company_id` |
| **Policy resolution** | Policies match `company_id` first; tenant default fallback |
| **Approver pool** | Approvers must have role in same company |
| **Cross-company transfer** | Closes workflow on company A employee; starts onboarding on company B |
| **Payroll run** | Never spans companies — one run = one company |
| **Group admin** | May view consolidated inbox; cannot approve without company role |
| **Inter-company loan** | Not supported — loan tied to employing company |

---

## Multi Branch Workflow Rules

| Rule | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Branch policy override** | Optional `branch_id` on approval policy |
| **Manager scope** | Manager approves only direct reports in allowed branches |
| **Attendance device** | Sync scoped to device `branch_id` |
| **Holiday calendar** | Branch-specific holidays affect attendance engine |
| **ESS check-in** | Validates employee primary or allowed branch |
| **Announcement** | Scope: company, branch, or department |

---

scheduled / webhook trigger
        ↓
connect device
        ↓
pull logs (since last_sync_at)
        ↓
normalize payload
        ↓
write hr_attendance_logs
        ↓
queue attendance engine job
        ↓
update device last_sync_at
        ↓
on failure → retry + alert HR admin
```

### Manual / bulk paths

| Path | Flow |
|------|------|
| **Manual** | HR enters punch → validation → engine (source = manual) |
| **Bulk import** | Upload → staging → validate all → commit → engine batch |

---

## Attendance Correction Workflow

**Workflow ID:** `hr.attendance.correction`  
**Model:** `hr_attendance_corrections`

```text
Employee Request (ESS) / HR Entry
        ↓
Manager Review              [policy: hr.attendance.correction]
        ↓
HR Review                   [optional per company policy]
        ↓
Approval / Rejection
        ↓
Attendance Recalculation    [engine re-runs for date]
        ↓
Audit Log                   [original + corrected snapshot]
```

| State | Actor |
|-------|-------|
| `draft` | Employee / HR |
| `pending_manager` | Line manager |
| `pending_hr` | HR Executive |
| `approved` | System recalculates |
| `rejected` | Terminal — reason required |

**Events:** `hr.attendance.correction.submitted` · `hr.attendance.corrected` · `hr.attendance.correction.rejected`

**Payroll rule:** If period locked, correction creates adjustment for next open period.

---

# Shift Management Workflow

**Workflow ID:** `hr.shift`  
**Models:** `hr_shift_definitions` · `hr_shift_assignments`

```text
Shift Creation
        ↓
Shift Policy Setup          [grace, late, OT rules]
        ↓
Shift Assignment            [employee or rotation]
        ↓
Attendance Mapping          [engine uses shift for date]
        ↓
Payroll Impact              [night allowance, OT multiplier]
```

### Shift types

| Type | Workflow notes |
|------|----------------|
| **Fixed (General)** | Static start/end on assignment |
| **Rotational** | `hr_shift_rotations` auto-advances pattern |
| **Flexible** | Core hours window; status from hours worked |
| **Night** | `crosses_midnight`; night allowance component |

### Assignment workflow

```text
draft assignment
        ↓
validate (no overlap, within policy)
        ↓
active (effective_from)
        ↓
superseded (new assignment effective)
        ↓
archived
```

**Event:** `hr.shift.assigned` → attendance engine invalidates cache for employee date range.

| Balance | `closing_balance >= days_count` OR policy allows negative |
| Overlap | No duplicate approved leave same dates |
| Notice | Min advance days per leave type |
| Blackout | Company blackout dates block submit |
| Probation | Type excluded during probation |

### Cancellation sub-flow

```text

## Leave Accrual Workflow

**Workflow ID:** `hr.leave.accrual` (scheduled batch)

```text
Monthly Accrual Job         [cron: 1st of month]
        ↓

# Employee Self Service Workflow

ESS routes requests to domain workflows — ESS is a **channel**, not a separate engine.

| ESS action | Target workflow | Approval chain |
|------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Profile update** | `ess.profile` | HR review for sensitive fields |
| **Leave request** | `hr.leave` | Manager → HR |

**Event:** `hr.document.expiring` · `hr.document.expired`

---

# Approval Engine (Universal)

HR registers with the **platform Approval Engine** — HR does not implement a local approval system.

### Supported patterns (all via Core)

| Pattern | Configuration | HR example |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| **Single approval** | Chain length = 1 | Short leave |
| **Multi-level** | Sequential steps | Loan |
| **Sequential** | Step N before N+1 | Payroll run |
| **Parallel** | All steps same order | Offer: HR + Finance |
| **Conditional** | Policy conditions | Days > 3 adds HR |
| **Role-based** | `assigned_role` | `hr.leave.approve` |
| **Amount-based** | `field_path: amount` | Expense tiers |
| **Company-based** | `company_id` on policy | Group of companies |

### Approval request lifecycle

```text
created → step_1_pending → … → approved
                         ↘ rejected (terminal)
                         ↘ cancelled (by submitter if allowed)
```

### Inbox aggregation

All HR approvals appear in global `/inbox/approvals` with module badge `HR` or `Payroll`.

| **Leave change** | balance_before, balance_after |
| **Payroll change** | run_id, state, totals |
| **Asset change** | asset_id, employee_id, action |

### Workflow engine hook

  1. Write activity_log
  2. Emit domain event
  3. Queue notifications
```

# Audit Workflow

Immutable audit trail for compliance — combines Activity Engine + domain history tables.

### Audit record structure (conceptual)

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Who** | `user_id`, `role`, `ip` (optional) |
| **When** | `timestamp` UTC |
| **What** | `action`, `entity_type`, `entity_id` |
| **Before value** | JSON snapshot or field diff |
| **After value** | JSON snapshot or field diff |
| **Reason** | User comment or system code |
| **Approval history** | `approval_request_id`, steps[] |

### High-audit workflows

| Workflow | Retention |
|----------|-----------|
| Payroll run | 7+ years |
| Payslip | 7+ years |
| Salary revision | Employment + 7 years |
| Termination | Permanent |
| Attendance correction | 3+ years |
| Loan / advance | Life of loan + 7 years |

### Audit export

Compliance export bundles Activity + approval history + payslip hashes for external auditor.

# AI Ready Workflows

AI OS participates as **assistant** — never bypasses Workflow or Approval Engine per [AI_OS_ARCHITECTURE.md](../../06-ai/platform/ai/AI_OS_ARCHITECTURE.md).

### Workflows with AI augmentation (future phases)

| Workflow | AI capability | Human gate |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| **Attendance daily** | Anomaly detection (missing punch pattern) | HR reviews flag |
| **Attendance correction** | Suggest approve/deny based on history | Manager decides |
| **Leave** | Leave pattern detection, staffing conflict warning | Manager decides |
| **Payroll run** | Validation — outliers, negative net, tax sanity | Payroll Officer |
| **Performance** | Promotion suggestions from ratings + skills | HR Manager |
| **Employee lifecycle** | Attrition prediction risk score | HR views dashboard |
| **Training** | Training recommendations from skill gaps | Employee/manager opts in |
| **Recruitment** | Resume screening score | Recruiter decides |
| **Overtime** | Unusual OT spike explanation | HR investigates |

### AI workflow pattern

```text
Scheduled / event trigger
        ↓
AI Service analyzes (read-only APIs)
        ↓
Write insight to read model + activity_ai_actions
        ↓
Surface in UI / AI chat
        ↓
Optional: user invokes "Apply suggestion"
        ↓
Starts normal workflow (human approval required)
```

### AI tools linked to workflows (planned)

| Tool | Workflow |
|------|----------|
| `hr.explain_attendance_anomaly` | Attendance |
| `hr.suggest_leave_coverage` | Leave |
| `payroll.validate_run` | Payroll |
| `hr.suggest_promotion` | Performance |
| `hr.attrition_risk` | Lifecycle |
| `hr.recommend_training` | Training |

# Cross-Module Workflow Integration

| External module | Event | HR/Payroll action |
|-----------------|-------|-------------------|
| **Accounting** | Period closed | Block payroll post |
| **Accounting** | Payment recorded | Mark expense reimbursed |
| **Inventory** | Asset received | Create `hr_assets` |
| **Sales** | Invoice paid | Commission workflow trigger |
| **Timesheet** | Approved hours | OT input validation |
| **Core Users** | User deactivated | Exit workflow reminder |

**Rule:** Integration via **events and service APIs only** — no workflow engine cross-module DB coupling.

---

## Child Documentation Roadmap

| Document | Depends on this blueprint |
|----------|---------------------------|
| `API.md` | Transition endpoints map to workflow actions |
| `Permissions.md` | Transition permissions per state |
| `INTEGRATION.md` | Event catalog per transition |
| `AI.md` | AI hook points per workflow |
| UI prototype | State bars, approval panels, checklists |

**Pre-code gate:** Status **Ready** per [GOVERNANCE.md](../../00-foundation/GOVERNANCE.md) before implementation.
